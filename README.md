## 📌 Problem Statement


**Problem Statement 1 - Weave AI magic with Groq**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Developers spend up to 60% of their time reading and understanding complex, undocumented codebases, leading to slow onboarding, reduced productivity, and frustration, especially for new hires. Viksit.AI addresses this by automatically generating clear documentation, answering code-related queries, and making technical knowledge easily accessible by helping users visualize the project as well as providing a real time compilation support — empowering all developers, including those from socially backward communities, to contribute efficiently and confidently.

This project empowers developers, students, and individuals worldwide by providing equitable access to AI, breaking barriers of privilege and opportunity.

### Your Approach:  
- Why you chose this problem  
    
    When I first joined as an intern, I was tasked with working on a project where the codebase consisted of thousands of lines of cluttered, undocumented code. This made it incredibly challenging to understand the project, and I found myself repeatedly asking senior developers for clarification. The constant back-and-forth was time-consuming and hindered my productivity. This experience sparked the idea for Viksit.AI — an AI-powered developer guru

- Key challenges you addressed  

    API Integration: Implemented real-time code compilation through external APIs.
    Deployment Issues: Resolved dependency conflicts during project deployment.
    Streamlit Styling: Handled challenges in visualizing and styling the project with Streamlit.
            
- Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking  

    During the time of hacking we decided to implement the community part during one of our brainstroming sessions and that's where we got the idea of making a multilingual community which was a major breakthrough
